In order to study the expression and regulation of genes in cells directly, scholars put forward the concept of reporter, and develop many useful report systems. The luciferase luxï¼Œ which found in the vibrio genome, is one of report systems. Bacterial luciferase is a flavin-dependent monooxygenase, catalyzing the reaction of O2 with reduced FMN and a long-chain aliphatic aldehyde, with concomitant emission of blue-green light. Compared with the popular reporter gene GFP, lux with hypo-toxicity and auto-luminance still worth further consideration and is of great potentiality.
EvolvR, a system that can continuously diversify all nucleotides within a tunable window length at user-defined site, is an attractive method for continuous directed evolution. After the expression of user-designed gRNA, enCas9 is mediated to target and nick the user-defined loci on the genome or plasmid. The pol13M mutant with low fidelity degrades single strand from 5' to 3' from the nick and resynthesizes a new strand with a length of about 350bp. The EvolvR system enables targeted genes to mutate, express, be screened in vivo, thus, it achieves continuous directed evolution.

We believe that the EvolvR system is a capable continuous directed evolution tool, and the optimized luciferase system is worth expecting, so we set up the project.
