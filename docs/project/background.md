In order to study the expression and regulation of genes in cells more directly and deeply, scholars put forward the concept of reporter gene, and develop many reporter systems. The luciferase luxï¼Œ which found in the vibrio genome, is also a kind of report system. Bacterial luciferase is a flavin-dependent monooxygenase, catalyzing the reaction of O2 with reduced FMN and a long-chain aliphatic aldehyde, and releasing oxidized FMN, water, and a fatty acid, with concomitant emission of blue-green light 

Compared with the reporter gene GFP commonly used in the academic world today, lux with hypo-toxicity and auto-luminance still worth further consideration and is of great potential application.   

EvolvR, a system that can continuously diversify all nucleotides within a tunable window length at user-defined site, is an attractive method for continuously directed evolution. After the expression of user-designed gRNA, enCas9 is mediated to target and nick the user-defined loci on the genome or plasmid. The pol13M mutant with low fidelity degrades single strand from 5' to 3' from the nick and synthesizes a new strand replacing with a length of about 350bp. The EvolvR system enable targeted genes to mutate, express, be screened according to phenotype. Recycling these steps can achieve continuous-mutagenesis in vivo.

We believe that the optimized luciferase system is worth expecting, and the EvolvR system is a capable continuous directed evolution tool, so we set up the project.
