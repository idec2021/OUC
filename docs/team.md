# <b>OUC-IDEC</b>
We are a group of young people who love biology. When we noticed the information of this wonderful competition, we decided to participate without hesitation, though we are ineperienced at first. This project is the first scientific research project for most of members of our team. We highly appreciate iDEC committee to provide us a research platform to enjoy lectures of outstanding academic scholars and communicate with other excellent teams who indicate great passion in biology. . It is an indisputable fact that we have some problems in project design and experiment execution, which may waste lots of time. But，failure, same as success, is a result. these failure experiences encourage us to reflect and imrpove，promote us to progress, and dramatically enhance our love of the biological science. As Milan Kundera once said, “Einmal ist keinmal”. In the future, we will continue this project and do our best to complete it，further verify our ideas, and keep our love of biology.

Weizhe Chen, a senior student in Ocean University of China, majors in Biological Science. Curious about biology, she joined the Life Science Association in the freshmen year. Reading and discussing frontier technology of molecular biology  with other members of the association, conducting basic microbiological and molecular experiment have deeply increased her passion for biological science. It was by chance that she learnt about this competition and decided to organized a undergraduate team. It is the first time she acts as a team leader. A tough trying, but she still enjoy it.  She plans to study for doctorate next year.

Jiushi Wei is a junior majoring in biological sciences at Ocean University of China.
As a student who loves experimental life, Jiushi Wei has been actively studying and engaged in scientific research experiments since his freshman year, and has mastered excellent basic molecular experiment skills.
He always believed that science was as romantic and mysterious as literature.
In the future, he will pursue a graduate degree in biological science and explore the world he loves.
